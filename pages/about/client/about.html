            <section><strong>Joshua Alvarado</strong> is a rising junior pursuing his major in Computer Science.
            He is from Queens, New York City and has developed a love for coding during
            his time at Brandeis. Having once participated in Pito Salas’ class
            “Software Entrepreneurship”, he and his team worked on a startup named
            AmIFull, which served to provide businesses valuable metrics on their own
            customer tendencies, as well as their local competitors. He created a forum
            named “IT. What is IT?”. Click <a href="">here</a> to join his forum.</section>
